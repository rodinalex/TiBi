# TiBiPy Project Roadmap

## Features
- Toggle wireframe on and off
- Export the system to a file
- Import a system from a file
- Add hints for the status bar
- Selectively hide sites for clarity
- Fix the band plotting layout
- Figure out dragging of hoppings between different site pairs
- Undo possibility
- New project button with a corresponding warning
- Progress bar for calculations

## Functionality
- Threads/workers

## Tasks
- Figure out and cleanup the toolbar/menu layout to start implementing relevant actions

## Bugs
<!-- - Check that the displacements are unique in coupling table
- Add button coloring
- Add "Hermitian Check" -->
<!-- 
## Core Functionality

- Add proper data persistence:
  - Implement save/load functionality for unit cells
  - Support common file formats (CIF, POSCAR, etc.)
  - Add auto-save functionality

- Improve UnitCell visualization:
  - Add 3D visualization of unit cells using OpenGL or similar
  - Enable interactive rotation and zoom
  - Display sites within the unit cell

- Implement site and state management:
  - Enable adding multiple sites to a unit cell
  - Allow managing quantum states for each site
  - Calculate and display site properties

## Advanced Features

- Add symmetry operations:
  - Implement space group detection
  - Enable symmetry-based operations on unit cells
  - Provide symmetry visualization

- Physics calculations:
  - Add basic energy calculations
  - Implement Hamiltonian construction for states
  - Enable simple simulations

- Batch operations:
  - Support for working with multiple unit cells
  - Comparative analysis tools
  - Batch export/import functionality

## UI Improvements

- Add context menus to tree view
- Implement drag-and-drop for reorganizing elements
- Add undo/redo functionality
- Improve application styling and themes
- Add keyboard shortcuts

## Documentation and Testing

- Add proper docstrings to all classes and methods
- Create user documentation with usage examples
- Implement unit tests for core functionality
- Add integration tests for UI components -->
