# TiBi Architecture Optimization

This document provides recommendations for optimizing the TiBi application architecture based on a review of the current implementation.

## Current Architecture Assessment

The TiBi project has successfully implemented a robust MVC architecture with:

- **Models**:
  - Clean domain models in `src/tibitypes.py` (UnitCell, Site, State, etc.)
  - Reactive data models in `models/data_models.py` with proper signal emission
  - Clear separation of domain data from presentation

- **Views**:
  - Well-organized UI components in the `views/` directory
  - Proper signal emission for user interactions
  - Focus on presentation without business logic

- **Controllers**:
  - Dedicated controllers for each functional area
  - Proper mediation between models and views
  - Good use of the signal/slot mechanism for loose coupling

The implementation shows particular strengths in:

1. **Signal Mechanism**: Excellent use of Qt's signal/slot for loose coupling
2. **Coordinating Controller Pattern**: AppController properly coordinates cross-component interactions
3. **Clean Encapsulation**: Controllers properly encapsulate their internal state
4. **Reactive Data Binding**: Changes in models automatically propagate to views
5. **Signal Coalescing**: Batch updates to avoid redundant view refreshes

## Optimization Recommendations

### 1. Naming Consistency

Some naming inconsistencies exist that should be standardized:

| Area | Current Patterns | Recommended Standard |
|------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Controller Constructors | Some take direct references to models/views and others take collections | All controllers should follow the same pattern |
| Internal Method Prefixes | Mix of `_method_name` and non-prefixed methods in same controllers | Use `_` prefix consistently for all internal methods |
| Signal Naming | Mix of verb-noun and noun patterns | Use verb-noun (e.g., `compute_bands_request` not just `bands_request`) |
| Controller Parameter Names | Mix of `unit_cells` and `unit_cell` for same concept | Use plurals for collections, singular for individual items |

Specific examples:

- In `BrillouinZonePlotController`: Rename `compute_bands_request` to maintain verb-noun pattern
- In constructors: Standardize parameter names across controllers (e.g., all controllers should use `unit_cells` not a mix of `unit_cells` and `unit_cell`)
- In `set_unit_cell()` methods: Consider renaming to `update_unit_cell()` for clarity
- In internal methods: Ensure all private methods have `_` prefix

### 2. Consider ViewModel Layer

For complex visualizations, a dedicated ViewModel layer could further improve separation of concerns:

```python
class BandStructureViewModel:
    def __init__(self, band_structure_model):
        self.band_structure_model = band_structure_model
        self.band_structure_model.signals.updated.connect(self.prepare_view_data)
        
    def prepare_view_data(self):
        # Transform raw model data into view-specific format
        # Calculate tick positions, normalize data ranges, etc.
        pass
```

### 3. Consistent Error Handling

Implement a consistent error handling strategy:

```python
# In controllers
try:
    result = self.perform_computation()
except ComputationError as e:
    self.handle_error(e)
    
def handle_error(self, error):
    # Log error
    # Update UI with error message
    # Reset state if needed
```

### 4. Documentation Improvements

Add interface documentation to clearly define component contracts:

```python
class IBandDataModel:
    """Interface that defines band data model requirements"""
    def get_band_data(): 
        """
        Returns band structure data.
        
        Returns:
            dict: Contains 'k_path', 'bands', and 'special_points' keys
        """
        pass
```

### 5. State Management Optimization

Consider using a dedicated state machine for complex UI state:

```python
class ComputationState(Enum):
    IDLE = 0
    SELECTING_PATH = 1
    COMPUTING = 2
    RESULTS_AVAILABLE = 3
    ERROR = 4

# In controller
def transition_to(self, new_state):
    # Handle state transitions
    self.current_state = new_state
    self.update_ui_for_state()
```

### 6. Performance Considerations

Optimize band computation and visualization:

1. Consider using worker threads for band computation
2. Implement progressive rendering for large datasets
3. Add caching for frequently accessed computations

```python
# Example worker thread implementation
class BandComputationWorker(QThread):
    computation_finished = Signal(object)
    
    def __init__(self, hamiltonian, k_path):
        self.hamiltonian = hamiltonian
        self.k_path = k_path
        
    def run(self):
        bands = band_compute(self.hamiltonian, self.k_path)
        self.computation_finished.emit(bands)
```

## Implementation Priorities

### High Priority

1. **Fix Naming Inconsistencies**: Standardize method and parameter names across controllers
2. **Complete Band Structure Implementation**: Finish the band plotting with proper error handling
3. **Optimize Signal Handling**: Ensure all DataModel updates properly coalesce signals

### Medium Priority

1. **Add Worker Thread for Computation**: Move band calculation to a separate thread
2. **Enhance BZ Plot Interactivity**: Add animations and visual cues for selected points
3. **Documentation**: Add comprehensive docstrings and interface documentation

### Low Priority

1. **Add ViewModel Layer**: For complex visualizations like band structure
2. **State Machine**: For managing UI state transitions
3. **Caching Layer**: For expensive computations

## Conclusion

The TiBi application demonstrates a well-designed MVC architecture. By addressing the minor inconsistencies and implementing the recommended optimizations, it will become even more maintainable and performant as new features are added.

The current focus on band structure implementation is well-supported by the existing architecture, and the signal-based reactive approach will scale well as the application grows more complex.
